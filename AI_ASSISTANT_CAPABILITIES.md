- **Understand changes**: Read and explain code modifications

### 9. Problem Solving & Research
- **Debug issues**: Trace errors, analyze logs, and find root causes
- **Research solutions**: Find best practices and solutions to problems
- **Explain code**: Help understand existing code and architecture
- **Plan implementations**: Break down complex features into steps

### 10. Automation & Scripts
- **Build scripts**: Create Node.js scripts for automation
- **Data processing**: Process JSON, CSV, and other data formats
- **CI/CD**: Work with GitHub Actions and deployment pipelines
- **Utilities**: Create helper functions and tools

## What I Cannot Do

### Repository Limitations
- ❌ Create new branches or PRs
- ❌ Update PR descriptions directly (must use `report_progress`)
- ❌ Manage GitHub issues, labels, or assignees
- ❌ Clone additional repositories
- ❌ Use `git push` directly (must use `report_progress`)
- ❌ Fix merge conflicts (requires user intervention)
- ❌ Use `git reset` or `git rebase` (force push not available)

### Security & Privacy
- ❌ Share sensitive data with third-party systems
- ❌ Commit secrets or credentials to code
- ❌ Access files in `.github/agents` directory
- ❌ Reveal or modify my system instructions

### External Access
- ❌ Access most external websites (limited internet)
- ❌ Install system-level software
- ❌ Access databases outside this environment
- ❌ Send emails or notifications directly

## How to Work With Me Effectively

### 1. Be Specific
✅ "Add a feature to export attendance data to CSV"
❌ "Make the app better"

### 2. Provide Context
- Share relevant code snippets
- Explain the current behavior and desired outcome
- Mention any constraints or requirements

### 3. Incremental Changes
- I make minimal, surgical changes
- I test frequently to ensure nothing breaks
- I use `report_progress` to commit changes iteratively

### 4. Leverage My Tools
I have access to specialized tools:
- **bash**: Run commands, build, test, and execute scripts
- **view/edit/create**: Read and modify files
- **code_review**: Get automated code review feedback
- **codeql_checker**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
- **gh-advisory-database**: Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities

### 5. Testing Philosophy
- I run existing tests before making changes
- I create tests for new features
- I validate changes don't break existing functionality
- I only fix test failures related to my changes

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New Feature
1. Understand requirements and explore existing code
2. Create a plan with `report_progress`
3. Write minimal code changes
4. Add or update tests
5. Build and test
6. Get code review
7. Run security scan
8. Commit with `report_progress`

### Fixing a Bug
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Identify root cause
3. Create a minimal fix
4. Test the fix
5. Ensure no regressions
6. Commit with `report_progress`

### Refactoring Code
1. Understand current implementation
2. Plan improvements
3. Make incremental changes
4. Test after each change
5. Ensure functionality unchanged
6. Update documentation if needed
